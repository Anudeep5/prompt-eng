      "\n",
      "### Server-Side Logic\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Database Management**: The platform's database will store user information, query data, and activity logs.\n",
      "*   **Server-Side Scripting**: PHP or Python will be used as server-side languages to handle authentication, authorization, and other backend tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Security Measures\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Encryption**: Queries will be stored in an encrypted format to ensure the security of user data.\n",
      "*   **Firewall Configuration**: A firewall will be configured to restrict access to unauthorized users.\n",
