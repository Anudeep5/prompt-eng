# Prompt Engineering Lessons

Prompt engineering is a rapidly growing discipline focused on developing and optimizing prompts to maximize the effectiveness of language models (LMs) across various applications and research fields. This site serves as a comprehensive guide designed to help students, researchers, and developers master prompt engineering through theory, practical exercises, and hands-on experience using Python code and Jupyter notebooks.

We provide:

* **Techniques and Methods**: Master key prompting techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, and self-consistency prompting.
* **Model-Specific Customization**: Learn how to create effective prompts tailored for different models such as Llama, Phi, Qwen and others.
* **Hands-on Experience**: experiement with different Prompt Experience Techniques through Jupyter notebook and Python code.

# Configure your Enviroment

Our exercises can be executed from Jupyter Notebooks that you can setup in different ways:
* **use your computer**, e.g. using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) or [installing Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)
* **use [MyBinder.org](http://mybinder.org)**: we provide links to Binder Notebooks in every exercise

To install on your computer, you first have to clone the code from Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GenILab-FAU/prompt-eng.git prompt-eng
```

In any case you need to adjust the CONFIGURATION file:

[prompt-eng/config](./prompt-eng/config)
